        The first definition of cocktail known to be an alcoholic beverage
        appeared in <em>The Balance and Columbian Repository</em> (Hudson, New York) May
        13, 1806; editor Harry Croswell answered the question, "What is a
        cocktail?": 
        <br></br> <strong>Cock-tail</strong> is a stimulating liquor, composed of spirits of
        any kind, sugar, water, and bitters‚Äîit is vulgarly called bittered
        sling, and is supposed to be an excellent electioneering potion, in as
        much as it renders the heart stout and bold, at the same time that it
        fuddles the head. It is said, also to be of great use to a democratic
        candidate: because a person, having swallowed a glass of it, is ready to
        swallow any thing else.
